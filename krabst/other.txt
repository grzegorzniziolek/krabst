When it might cause issues to add js script in body tag
If the script manipulates or needs access to elements in the <body> before they exist in the DOM. For example:


<head>
  <script>
    document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', () => alert('Hi'));
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="btn">Click me</button>
</body>


Now I can see the problem! The issue is with the script loading order in your home.html file. Here are the problems:
Scripts are loading in the <head> before the DOM elements exist
The carousel.js script tries to access DOM elements that don't exist yet
The navbar.js script is also loading before the DOM is ready

Solution: scripts have to be added after body DOM construction so at the end of the body tag
